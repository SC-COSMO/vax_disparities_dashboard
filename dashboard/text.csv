About,Title,Title,Tracking Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccination
Maps,Above tabs,Text,"Tracking racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage across US states is essential to advancing vaccine equity. State-level data needed to monitor levels and trends in vaccination disparities are incomplete and diverse. We applied consistent rules to reconcile data, estimate historical coverage, and project future coverage of COVID-19 vaccinations."
Maps,Below tabs,Text,"Maps show variation in coverage of at least one dose ages 12 years and older across states and by race/ethnicity.

About,Below tabs 3,Text,"We are grateful for the tireless work of analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who routinely extract and compile data from state dashboards to provide breakdowns of vaccinations by race/ethnicity."
About,Below tabs 4,Header,Methods
About,Below tabs 5,Text,"We use historical state-reported vaccination data by race/ethnicity to project vaccine coverage, by state and nationally, among people ages 12 and older for four mutually exclusive racial/ethnic groups (White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian). Specifically, we used data on distribution of vaccines administered by race/ethnicity extracted from state reporting dashboards by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the percentage of people ages 12 and older who have received at least one dose from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and population data from the 2019 American Community Survey to estimate the share of people ages 12 years and older receiving one or more COVID-19 vaccination doses, by state and race/ethnicity. We project coverage rates through December 31, 2021 based on the average vaccination rate between July 19 and August 16 for each racial/ethnic group, by state. "
